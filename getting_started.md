## Before the First Class

### 1. Set Up Your Google Account

We'll be using Google Colab throughout the course, which requires a Google account.

1. If you don't already have a Google account, create one at [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)
2. Log in to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to make sure you can access it

### 2. Course Materials Access

You have two options for accessing course materials:

#### Option A: Directly from GitHub (Recommended)

1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click File > Open notebook
3. Select the GitHub tab
4. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/autom8or-com/python-data-analysis-course`
5. Navigate to `Month_1/Week_1/Lecture` to find the first week's notebooks

#### Option B: Create a Copy in Google Drive

1. Open a notebook using Option A
2. Click File > Save a copy in Drive
3. The notebook will be saved to your Google Drive

### 3. Download the Olist Dataset

1. Go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
2. Download the dataset files
3. Keep them handy for upload during class sessions

### 4. Explore the Course Resources

Take some time to explore these key documents:

- `course_overview.md`: Course goals, structure, and assessment
- `Syllabus.md`: Detailed weekly topics
- `course_calendar.md`: Schedule with all important dates
- `Resources/learning_pathway.md`: Learning progression guide
- `Resources/sql_to_pandas.md`: SQL to Python translation guide

## First Class Preparation

For our first class on April 9th, please:

1. Review your SQL knowledge, particularly:
   - Basic queries (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
   - Aggregations (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG)
   - Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)

2. Browse through these introductory materials:
   - `Resources/templates/Colab_Introduction.ipynb`
   - `Month_1/Week_1/Lecture/`: First week's lecture notebooks

3. Prepare any questions you have about the course

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues with setup or access:

1. Check the `Resources/FAQ.md` document for common questions
2. Refer to `Resources/guides/` for specific setup instructions
3. Email the instructor at [instructor-email@example.com]

## Next Steps

After completing the setup:

1. Create a folder structure in your Google Drive for organizing your work
2. Bookmark the GitHub repository for easy access
3. Familiarize yourself with Google Colab's interface
4. Review the assessment structure and due dates
